Hacker1 BBP/VDP guide

VDP vs BBP
BBP pays, VDP primarily gives attention

public vs private: private requires clout

how to earn invites:
h101 ctf (26 points)
submit reports to public programs

reading policy:
bounty tiers
minimums and maximums

scoping:
wildcard - any subdomain in scope

safe harbor: when a vuln is out of scope: if the hacking is done in good faith, you're not trying to bribe or extort, and is done in a safe way so as to help the company, they will not sue or press charges.
