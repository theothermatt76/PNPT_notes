- tools in menu sorted in order of ATT&CK kill chain

- no longer root by default, must use sudo
	- he recommends "sudo su -", dont use that. using an authz provider to call another authz provider is bad joo joo and can cause problems. use "sudo -i" instead
- he is really mediocre on linux...
- he recommends ifconfig. dont, it's deporecated. use "ip addr show"
- also, iwconfig...still works, but so does "ip addr show"
- arp -a: IP adderesses this talks to, and MAC it is attached to. use (ip n)
- netstat -ano (i use -ant), but netstat is also depricated. use "ss" with mostly the same flags
- route - default routing table (use "ip r")
