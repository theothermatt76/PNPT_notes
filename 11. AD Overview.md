1. AD Overview
- what is AD? a phonebook
	- stores objects, directory services
		- users, printers, computers, etc
	 -Authenticates using Kerberos tickets
		- non-windows devices can authenticate against AD via radius or ldap
- why is AD?
	- the most common (95% of f100 companies use it) identity management service in the world
	- can be exploited without ever attacking patchable exploits
		- feature abuse, trusts, components, etc

2. Physical components
- domain controller: a computer with the ActiveDirectory DirectoryStore service role enabled that is promoted to a controller
	- hosts a copy of the AD DS store
	- provides authn and authz
	- replicate updates across to other controllers in the domain forrest
	- user and network resource management/administration
	- think beyond the controller: pii, financials, etc
- active directory data store
	- ntds.dit: get it
		- this holds EVERYTHING in regards to the domain
	- stored in %systemroot%/NTDS
	- accessible only through domain controller processes and protocols
 

3. logical components
- AD DS schema
	- defines every type of object that can be stored in the directory
	- enforces rules regarding object creation and configuration
- domains: used to group and manage objects in an org
	- an administrative boundary
	- a replication boundary
	- authn/z and scope limiting boundary
- trees
	- a group of domains (think sub domains)
	- all domains in the tree share a namespace to the parent
	- can have child domains
	- default tywo-way trust with the other domains in the group
- forrest
	- a collection of trees
	- share a common schema, configuration prtition, global catalog
	- enables trusts between all domains i nthe forrest
	- shar ethe enterprise admin role
- OU: organizational Unit
	- just a container for objects
	- represent the org logically and hierarchically
	- delegate permissions to groups of objects
	- apply policies
- trusts
	- provides access between resources
		- directional (cross domains)
		- transitive (extended beyond the 2-way to include other trusted domains)
		- all domains in a forrest trust all domains in the forrest. trickle down.
- objects
	- users
	- contacts
	- groups
	- computers
	- printers
	- inetorgperson
	- shared folders...
