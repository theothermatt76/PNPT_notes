Scanning and enumeration

* Download Kioptrix level one ova (or package from vulnhub...harder...)
*  256mb ram is plenty, it runs in hte background
*  this is a bitch. networking is probably not working
	*  https://medium.com/@obikag/how-to-get-kioptrix-working-on-virtualbox-an-oscp-story-c824baf83da1

NMAP scanning
* find kioptrix ip
	* arp-scan -l
	* netdiscover
* nmap -T4 -p- -A <host>
	* T is speed: 1-5...slower is usually better
	* p- is all ports
	* A is EVERYTHING. Tell me version, os, fingerprinting, etc.
		* A is slower. maybe just -p-, get open ports, then A those ports
	* -sU is the UDP scan
		* dont so it. remove the A and only scan select ports (-p is top 1024)

Enumeration: https

*	Low hanging fruit, go for http/s first
*	process
	1. Try visiting the site...
		1. here we just get the default...but it's giving too much info
		2. view the source!
	2. take notes! include timestamp, screenshot, and finding
		1. make a directory on your kali and save scan output (consider screen)
		2. change your shell to include the date/time
	3. try nikto
		1. nikto -h http://10.0.0.191

+ mod_ssl/2.8.4 appears to be outdated (current is at least 2.8.31) (may depend on server version)
**+ mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0082, OSVDB-756.**

Remember...low hanging fruit. This is remote, and very detailed.

	4. dirbuster (or dirb, or gobuster)
		1. wordlist is /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster
		2. be very careful of how many threads you run! He says 200, but this is noisey and can ddos.
		3. start with small list
	5. fire up burp and point your browser to the proxy
		1. intercept a request (reload page), send to "repeater"
			1. your response may show some interesting info (versioning in header)
	6. When the results finish, check them out.
		1. beware of rabbit trails, you're going to find lots of rabbit trails. TAKE GOOD NOTES of dead ends too, they may be helpful in the future

Enumeration: SSH

* what if we dont have the version?
	*	remember, we are just info gathering. logging in would be exploitation ^C out after checking for header
	*	 old versions may require kex and cypher touches:

Research Potential Vulnerabilities (google, or searchsploit)

1. mod_ssl/2.8.4 - mod_ssl 2.8.7 and lower are vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow which may allow a remote shell. http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0082, OSVDB-756

possible vulnerable to openfuck: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47080

2. SMB (Samba 2.2.1a)

Possible vulnerabilities:

trans2open overflow https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/samba/trans2open/

RCE: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/10

same as trans2open RBO: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7

3. Webalizer 2.01
possibly a few XSS, and maybe an RBO: https://www.rapid7.com/db/vulnerabilities/linuxrpm-RHSA-2002-254/

No exploits in searchsploit.
