Info gathering

Passive Recon Overview:
* physical/social
	* location info
		* sat images
		* drone recon
		* building layout (badge readers, break areas, security, fences, etc.)
	* Job information
		* employee names (titles, phone numbers, managers, etc.)
		* pictures (badge photos, desk photos, computer screen photos, etc.)
* web/host (do i have the right host?)
	* target validation
		* whois, nslookup, dnsrecon
	* finding subdomains
		* google fu, dig, nmap, sublist3r, bluto, crt.sh, etc.
	* fingerprinting (what is running, without scanning deep)
		* nmap, wappalyzer, whatweb, builtwith, weleakinfo
	* breaches
		* haveibeenpwned, breach-parse, weleakinfo

OSINT:

Identifying our target (check out bugcrowd.com)
* watch out for scope. only play in the approved walls (though you may be able to report issues for out of scope things, DO NOT exploit them. PoC may be OK. again, know your RoE!)

email address gathering with hunter.io
* pay attention to the pattern. We can use this for credential stuffing.
* make a list of the personal, then try password spraying (Fall2021!)

gathering breached credentials with breach-parse (https://github.com/hmaverickadams)
* pasword file is like 44GB unzipped...and it's a torrent.
* you dont have to install
* look for patterns, pray and spray.

Hunting Subdomains
* start with sublist3r
* https://crt.sh - uses certificate registration (way deeper!!)
* owasp amass (slow)
	* challenged to get it installed
*  assess the results
	*  look for juicy bits (sso, mfa, vpn, mail, ftp)
	* tomnomnom's httprobe (is it alive?)

Identifying Website Technologies
* https://builtwith.com
* wappalyzer for firefox/chrome
* whatweb (built in to kali)
* will this lead to an exploit? maybe.

info gathering with burpsuite
* choose temporary, choose start
* in browser:
	* set manual proxy to 127.0.0.1:8080
		* foxyproxy?
	* use for all protocols
	* https://burp
		* download cert
		* install it in firefox
	* load your target...may need to refresh or click through a ton of cert warnings (new firefox...)
	* Look at proxy tab, things will stall untill you allow forwards.

google fu!
* site:
* filetype:

Utilizing Social Media
* linkedin: always people pictures on picture tab (badges, desks...)
	* people tab can get you possible usernames
	* consider using a fake linkedin or scraper
