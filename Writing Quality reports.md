Quality reports

High-quality reports help security teams quickly understand and triage vulnerabilities. A well-structured report improves response time and increases the likelihood of a positive outcome.

 

It's best to be comprehensive yet concise, as security teams need to have all the details required to verify and validate your report. We recommend you provide enough information to: 

    Outline the bug

    Reproduce the bug

    Assess the coverage the bug applies to

    Provide additional related logs or information

What Makes a Quality Report?

    A clear and concise title – Summarize the vulnerability in a way that helps security teams quickly understand the issue.

    Detailed steps to reproduce – Provide a step-by-step guide that allows the security team to replicate the issue easily. Screenshots, screen recordings, and code snippets are a great addition to improve clarity.

    Impact assessment – Explain the potential consequences of the vulnerability, including how an attacker could exploit it and what damage it could cause.

    Remediation suggestions (if possible) – While not required, including suggestions for fixing the issue can be helpful.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

    Vague reports – Avoid general statements like "There’s an XSS vulnerability." Provide detailed reproduction steps.

    Lack of impact explanation – Explain why the issue matters.

    Poor formatting – Use clear structure, headings, and bullet points to improve readability.

    Overloading with unnecessary details – Focus on what’s relevant to the security team.
